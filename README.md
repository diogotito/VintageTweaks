VintageTweaks
=============

I could just configure [NeoVintageous](https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous) to my liking.

Or I could hack a bunch of key bindings and Python commands on top of the built-in *Vintage* plugin to grab just the subset of Vim features I actually enjoy, which are:

  - keyboard-driven navigation
  - <code>&lt;C-w&gt;</code> window management

I prefer Sublime's features more than Vim's for the rest, and I find that the more advanced Vim emulation packages are too close to Vim for my liking.

But maybe I should just try NeoVintageous for real, so I'm putting my *Vintage*-enhancing key bindings and commands in this package so that I can easily toggle them all at once.
